# Directing_Customers_To_Subscription

In this case study we will be working for a fintech company that wants to provide it's customers with a paid mobile app subscription that will allow them to track all of their finances in one place.

To attract customers, the company releases a free version of their app with some of the main features unlocked.

The task is to identify which users will most likely NOT enroll in the paid product, so that additional offers can be given to them. Because of the Cost of these offers, the company does not want to offer them to everybody, especially the customers who were going to enroll anyways.

We have the access to each customer's app behavior data. This data allows us to see the date annd time of app insallation, as well as the features users engaged with within the app. App behavior is characterized as the list of app screens the user looked at, and whether the user played the financial mini-games available.

The app usage data is only from the user's first day in the app. This limitation exists because users can enjoy a 24-hour free trial of the premium features, and the company wants to target them with new offers shortly after the trial is over.
